## 🔥 Some Advanced Concepts

For those aiming to go beyond standard DSA:

- **Segment Tree & Fenwick Tree (BIT)** – For efficient range queries and updates.
- **Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)** – Used in Kruskal’s MST and cycle detection in graphs.
- **KMP & Rabin-Karp Algorithm** – Essential for efficient string pattern matching.
- **Number Theory & Mathematics** – Covers GCD, LCM, Modular Arithmetic, and Prime Factorization.
- **Advanced Graph Algorithms** – Includes Tarjan’s (SCC), Floyd-Warshall, and Johnson’s Algorithm.
- **Suffix Array & Suffix Tree** – Useful for advanced string matching problems.
- **Mo’s Algorithm** – Optimized approach for answering range queries offline.
- **Game Theory** – Includes Grundy numbers, Nim Game, and optimal strategies.
- **Trie + Bit Manipulation** – Useful for problems involving XOR queries and efficient searching.
- **Heavy-Light Decomposition (HLD)** – Advanced technique for handling tree queries efficiently.
