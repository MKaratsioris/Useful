## python:3.11

### ðŸ”’ Vulnerability Detected: CVE-2024-6345
- Affected Package: setuptools
- Installed Version: 65.5.1
- Fixed Version: 70.0.0
- Severity: Likely high (based on the use of GitHub Security Advisories and needing a patch)
- Path: usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/setuptools-65.5.1.dist-info/METADATA
- Reference: AVD: CVE-2024-6345
- Status: Fixed (upgrade available)

### âœ… Fix Recommendation
You should upgrade setuptools to version 70.0.0 or higher. 

#### Building a custome image
Update your Dockerfile to include:
```bash
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade setuptools
```
or explicitly
```bash
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir setuptools==70.0.0
```

#### Using python:3.11 directly:
You'll need to override the vulnerable version after the container starts or in your derived Dockerfile.
In your Dockerfile (or wherever setuptools is installed), change the version install line from:
```bash
pip install 'setuptools==65.5.1'
```
to
```bash
pip install 'setuptools>=70.0.0'
```
Example Dockerfile:
```bash
FROM python:3.11

# Upgrade pip and setuptools to safe versions
RUN pip install --upgrade pip setuptools>=70.0.0

# (Optional) Install your other dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Your existing steps (copy app code, set workdir, etc.)
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

Then rebuild your image:
```bash
docker build -t your-image-name .
```
After rebuilding, re-run Trivy to verify the vulnerability is gone.

## node:18

### ðŸ”’ Vulnerability Found
- Package: cross-spawn
- Installed Version: 7.0.3
- Vulnerability ID: CVE-2024-21538
- Severity: Likely High (source: ghsa)
- Fixed Versions:
  - 7.0.5 (preferred)
  - 6.0.6 (older major)

#### Using node:18 directly:
```bash
# Start from the official Node.js 18 image
FROM node:18

# Update npm to the latest stable version to get patched dependencies
RUN npm install -g npm@latest

# Optional: Ensure vulnerable package is not cached in global or local dirs
RUN npm cache clean --force

# Copy app code
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Build or run the app
CMD ["npm", "start"]  # Or ["npm", "run", "build"] for Angular
```
